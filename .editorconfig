# See http://editorconfig.org/
# EditorConfig helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles
# between different editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a
# file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins
# that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles.
# EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version
# control systems.
